# Unless you intent to deploy a home-region-specific copy of your
# application to your home region, which also contains a 'regional'
# copy of your application, this file should be blank.

# To reiterate - use generic_region (or a snowflake) to represent
# the regional copy of your application that happens to be in the
# home region unless you are very, very special.
